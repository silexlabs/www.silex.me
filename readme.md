<h1>SILEX FREE WEBSITE BUILDER</h1>

This repository [Silex free website builder](http://www.silex.me) is an official website which is available at http://www.silex.me and hosted for free by github with [gihub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The HTML page ```index.html``` is generated by Silex and is ready for deployment.

The HTML page ```editable.html``` is the "source" HTML file, editable in Silex itself. This page is made without programming, just simply drag and drop, with [Silex, live web creation](http://www.silex.me/). 

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute improvments.
